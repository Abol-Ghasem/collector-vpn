## How It Works

1. **source.txt**: This file includes configuration details that the project processes dynamically.
2. **vip.txt**: Contains pre-selected vip subscription links.
3. The webpage (index.html) uses JavaScript to load and display configurations and links.
4. Styling is managed through `styles.css` for a clean and user-friendly design.

## How to Use

1. Place your configuration data in `source.txt`.
2. Add your VIP subscription links in `vip.txt`.
3. Open `index.html` in any browser to view the results.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For adding dynamic functionality.
